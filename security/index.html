  <h1>Security Assessment of Not Foursquare</h1>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This assessment tests the security of the Not Foursquare web application.  This is a web application that takes in login and location parameters and provides them to the client.  However, this feature accounts for a major flaw that makes the application dangerous for public use.  The following document discusses the vulnerablilites found.</p>
  
  <h3>Methodology</h3>
  <p>I first utilized black-box testing, meaning I tested the application with only information available to an attacker.   I ran the code locally and utilized curl in order to find vulnerabilities.  I then reviewed the code in order to better understand possible vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
  <p>The root of the security issues I found was based on too much faith in user input.  There was an assumption that user input would be correct and therefore there wasn't any attempt to restrict or check user input leaving the application open to malicious attacks.  These issues will need to be resolved before it is safe to deploy for public use, otherwise viruses and other malicious attacks are likely.</p>
  
  <h3>Issues Found</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><h4>Alert Popup</h4>
      <p>I was able to implement three different instances of cross-site scripting.  Because there weren't any restrictions on login strings, I was able to insert an alert in the login parameter.  For example, running <xmp>curl --data "login=<script>alert('Hi');<script>&lat=10&lng=10" https://boiling-plataue-26702.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</xmp> I was able to insert an alert popup.  I also discovered a second security flaw. There aren't any security measures taken by Mongodb to validate input in the database.  I was able to retrieve the malicious script from the database with the following code: <xmp> curl -X GET "http://boiling-plataue-26702.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login=<script>alert('Hi');</script>"</xmp>  Severity of issue: low.  While this might be very annoying, it doesn't pose a serious threat to the security of the application.  <img src=./popup.png>  <br>This issue could be resolved by validating user input in both the POST and GET APIs before it can be added to the database and stopping insertion before it is added if it cannot be validated.  Because special characters are common in HTML and Javascript code that could pose a threat to the application, the user input could be filtered through a list of allowable characters and rejecting any input that contains characters such as '<, /, &, =, @,>'.  </p>
      </li>
    <li><h4>Inserted Image</h4>
      <p>Additionally, I was able to insert an image via the POST and GET APIs by inserting HTML code in the login parameter.  Again this field is not validated in any way.  I was able to insert malicous code that inserted an unwanted image.  Severity of issue: low.  While this example again is annoying, it points to a larger issue. This parameter is very easy to hack and more malicious code could very easily be implemented.  For example, running <xmp>curl --data "login-<img src = "http://dogbreedcartoon.com/dog-img/American-Eskimo-Dog.png">&lat=20&lng=20" https://boiling plateau-26702.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</xmp> followed by <xmp> curl -X GET "http://boiling-plataue-26702.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login=<img src=http://dogbreedcartoon.com/dog-img/American-Eskimo-Dog.png>"</xmp>   This issue can be resolved using the same method as above.   <br><img src=./image.png>   </p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>Unvalidated Redirect</h4>
	  <p>The most malicious of these vulnerabilities is the redirect injection.  I was able to redirect the user to a website of my choice by inserting some malicious code again in the login parameter.  For example, by typing the following in the login parameter <xmp>curl --data "login=<script>document.location='http://drunkronswanson.com'</script>&lat=40&lng=40 "https://boiling-plateau-26702.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</xmp> followed by <xmp>curl-X GET "https://boiling-plateau-26702.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login=<script>document.location='http://drunkronswanson.com'</script>"</xmp>  I was able to redirect the user to drunkronswanson.com.  Severity of issue: high.  The website the user is redirected to could be malicious.  Because of this, it is clear that the measures described above must be taken in order for the application to be operable.  Otherwise, the application is so vulnerable to malicious attacks, it is nearly unusable.  <br><img src = ./drunkronswanson.png> </p>
	    </li>
	<li><h4>Violation of SOP</h4>
	      <p>Additionally, this script allowed me to circumvent and violate the same-origin policy and redirect the user to another website.  Severity of risk: high.  Although the website that I redirected the user to was not a malicious website, it is easy to consider a circumstance where that website could have pulled data because CORS was enabled.  I assert that because of this, CORS poses an added risk for data leakage.  Because the server responds with <xmp>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * </xmp> the resource can be accessed by any domain.  In order to remedy this issue, the developer should either disable CORS or specify the domain that can access the resources.  </p>
		</li>
	<li><h4>Unsecure Access to Data</h4>
	      <p>It was unclear whether the developer assumed that latitude and logitude information should remain secure but assuming that it should remain secure, there are some issues.  When a user inputs their data via POST, such as <xmp> curl --data "login=danny&lat=0&lng=0" https://boiling-plateau-26702.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</xmp> the user might assume that their latitude and longitude entries will remain secure.  If the user's login information is shared, it is easy for a third party user to find out the user's location given their login information.  For example, if a third party user entered <xmp> curl -GET https://boiling-plateau-26702/checkin.JSON?login=danny</xmp>  <img src = ./codeclip.png>  <br>Severity of issue: high.  The result gives the third party access to the latitude and logitude inputs as well as the login information.  In order to fix this issue, the developer could send just the login information by changing <xmp> response.send(results)</xmp> to <xmp> response.send(results.login)</xmp> </p>
	      </li>
	  
    </ol>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The issues found make it easy for attackers to make the site unusable.  Further, an attacker could trick the client into giving sensitive information such as userID and password by using the unvalidated redirect and redirecting the client to a realistic imposter banking site.  Following the recommendations above will significantly reduce the effectiveness of these types of attacks.  All of the proposed improvements are easy to make but further investigation is necessary.  The use of tools such as Burp Suite could find further vulnerabilities and these might not be so easy to fix.  It is recommended that more extensive investigation is made beyond these basic attacks. </p>
