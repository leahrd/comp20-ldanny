I have implemented CSS sprites and media queries in order to display different sections of an image  based upon the screen size.  I googled some of the issues I ran into and utilized examples in order to find issues with my syntax.  

I spent approximately 2 and 1/2 hours on this lab.  I had a lot of issues with getting the image to appear which turned out to be syntax issues.
