I have successfully implemented JavaScript to annotate a music video with lyrics to 'My Old Kentucky Home'.  I have annotated the video, providing lyrics line-by-line.  I also included two images in my annotation although, I was unable to re-size them. 

I discussed this assignment with the course TA John Gallagher.

I had some difficulty with the addEventListener function so in total this assignment took me about 3 hours.
