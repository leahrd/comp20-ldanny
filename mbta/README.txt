I was able to create an index.html page where a google map of the mbta red line.  I labeled each station with an image and drew a red polyline that trace the path of the mbta red line.I used https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/full/images/beachflag.png for my image.  I hope this was OK.  I tried using my own "you are here image" but I was having a really hard time resizing it.  I was hoping to find a way to make more efficient but I didn't have enough time.

The only resources I used for this assignment were online resources I found online.  

This assignment took me about 5 hours.
