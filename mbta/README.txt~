I was able to create an index.html page where a google map of the mbta red line.  I labeled each station with an image and drew a red polyline that trace the path of the mbta red line.  I used a 'You Are Here' arrow for each of the stations.  I was hoping to resize the arrow smaller, but I wasn't able to do this successfully.  I resized the image and saved it but I wasn't able to get it to a scale I was happy with.  I was hoping to find a way to make more efficient but I didn't have enough time.

The only resources I used for this assignment were online resources I found online.  

This assignment took me about 5 hours.
